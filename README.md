# Blacklight Cornell Requests

## Overview
This project is a Rails engine designed to plug into a [Blacklight](http://projectblacklight.org) instance. It provides functionality for placing requests for materials from FOLIO (as a page, hold, or recall), document delivery, [BorrowDirect](https://ivpluslibraries.org/leadership-6-key-groups/resource-sharing/), Interlibrary Loan, and more. However, the current codebase is tightly integrated with [Cornell's Blacklight catalog](https://catalog.library.cornell.edu).
